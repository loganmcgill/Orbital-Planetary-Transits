# Transit
Made by **Logan McGill** and **Peter Macdonald**

**Acknowledgmenents:** Project inspired by the works of Richard Epp at the University of Waterloo, assignment from PHYS 175

Calculates values for a binary star system given mass of star, radius of star, star wobble and change in flux caused by the planetary transit. This code will give values for semi-major axis, or orbital radius of of the planet. Also finds orbital velocity, mass, radius and density of the planet.


**Note: It is possible to find values for the mass of a star and radius through it's luminance and flux, which are found by measuring temperature.

**Note: Assumes binary star system

**Note: Assumes circular planetary orbit
